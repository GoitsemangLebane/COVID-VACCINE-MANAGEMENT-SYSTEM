# COVID-VACCINE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
It is a CVMS that added patients who have received their covid-19 vaccination. It saves the data on a text file, saving the patient details, their work, the type of vaccination, dates and place of vaccination,etc.

The program was programmed using C++ language only and store its data in a textfile

The main aim of this project was to show case understanding of the binary search algorithm as well as the bubble sorting algorithm which are there on the source code. I was able to incorporate both algorithms in the code and they work well as expected.
